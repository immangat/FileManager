Project Title: Simple File Manager

Project Description:
Create a simple file manager that allows the user to view, create, edit, and delete files and directories on their computer. The file manager should have a text-based user interface that allows the user to navigate the file system, view file and directory contents, and perform basic file operations.

Requirements:
1. The file manager should support the following operations:
    - Navigate the file system and display directory contents
    - Create new files and directories
    - Edit existing files
    - Delete files and directories
2. The file manager should display a help menu that explains how to use each of the supported operations.
3. The file manager should be able to handle errors gracefully, such as when the user tries to create a file or directory that already exists or delete a file that does not exist.
4. The file manager should be able to handle different file types, such as text files and binary files.
5. The file manager should be able to handle directories of any size and depth.

Optional Features:
1. Allow the user to copy and move files and directories.
2. Add support for file compression and decompression.
3. Implement a search function that allows the user to search for files by name or content.
4. Add support for file permissions and access control.
